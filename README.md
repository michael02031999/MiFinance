# MiFinance

#### I made this app with the intention of keeping track of my finances. My app is broken into four components: index, data, journal, and quick add.

#### Index gives an overview of what this app is based on, what finance techniques.

#### Data records percentages of how you spend your money grouped into three categories

#### Journal records specific transactions accepting variables such as month, transaction type, transaction name, and price of purchase

#### My favorite feature is quick add that adds frequently purchased items so that you can quickly add them.

# That is my app! Hope you all enjoy!
